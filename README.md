## ❓ Why Use React Router?

React Router is a vital tool in React development, facilitating seamless navigation between different pages within a web application. It enables the creation of sophisticated websites with multiple pages while maintaining the underlying structure of a single-page application. When users interact with links or buttons to navigate, React Router dynamically updates the content on the screen without reloading the entire page from the internet. This enhances the user experience, making it smooth and intuitive.

## 📚 API Reference

Explore the CoinGecko API at www.coingecko.com/en/api. It is completely free.

## ❗ Encountered Error and issues

1. I used the makeStyles from MUI but learned that the makeStyles function is deprecated. To address this, create a separate CSS file.

2. Also, import the import useHistory hook was deprecated, so I used useNavigation instead.

3. CoinGecko API is being blocked by the CORS policy. Installing cores-anywhere resolved the problem.

```
npx cors-anywhere
```
